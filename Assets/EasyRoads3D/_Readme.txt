Thank you for purchasing EasyRoads3D Pro!

This package includes v2 and the v3 beta as a separate unityPackage.

V3 is an entirely new road system.

Conform the asset store guidelines both packages will be imported in the folder /Assets/EasyRoads3D/. Be careful if you do not want to mix version specific assets, you may want to import v2 first and rename the folder in for example "EasyRoads3D v2". Or deselect all assets in the import window apart from the v3 beta package. This will import the v3 beta unity package in /Assets/EasyRoads3D/. Double click this file to start the v3 import.
